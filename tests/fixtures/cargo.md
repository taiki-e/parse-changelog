# Changelog

## Cargo 1.50 (2021-02-11)
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
[8662ab42...HEAD](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/8662ab42...HEAD)

### Added
- Added the `doc` field to `cargo metadata`, which indicates if a target is
  documented.
  [#8869](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8869)

### Changed
- `.crate` files uploaded to a registry are now built with reproducible
  settings, so that the same `.crate` file created on different machines
  should be identical.
  [#8864](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8864)

### Fixed

### Nightly only
- Allow `resolver="1"` to specify the original feature resolution behavior.
  [#8857](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8857)
- Added `-Z extra-link-arg` which adds the `cargo:rustc-link-arg-bins`
  and `cargo:rustc-link-arg` build script options.
  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#extra-link-arg)
  [#8441](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8441)

## Cargo 1.49 (2020-12-31)
[75615f8e...rust-1.49.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/75615f8e...rust-1.49.0)

### Added
- Added `homepage` and `documentation` fields to `cargo metadata`.
  [#8744](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8744)
- Added the `CARGO_PRIMARY_PACKAGE` environment variable which is set when
  running `rustc` if the package is one of the "root" packages selected on the
  command line.
  [#8758](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8758)
- Added support for Unix-style glob patterns for package and target selection
  flags on the command-line (such as `-p 'serde*'` or `--test '*'`).
  [#8752](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8752)

### Changed
- Computed LTO flags are now included in the filename metadata hash so that
  changes in LTO settings will independently cache build artifacts instead of
  overwriting previous ones. This prevents rebuilds in some situations such as
  switching between `cargo build` and `cargo test` in some circumstances.
  [#8755](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8755)
- `cargo tree` now displays `(proc-macro)` next to proc-macro packages.
  [#8765](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8765)
- Added a warning that the allowed characters for a feature name have been
  restricted to letters, digits, `_`, `-`, and `+` to accommodate future
  syntax changes. This is still a superset of the allowed syntax on crates.io,
  which requires ASCII. This is intended to be changed to an error in the
  future.
  [#8814](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8814)
- `-p` without a value will now print a list of workspace package names.
  [#8808](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8808)

### Fixed
- Fixed building a library with both "dylib" and "rlib" crate types with LTO enabled.
  [#8754](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8754)
- Fixed paths in Cargo's dep-info files.
  [#8819](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8819)
- Fixed inconsistent source IDs in `cargo metadata` for git dependencies that
  explicitly specify `branch="master"`.
  [#8824](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8824)
- Fixed re-extracting dependencies which contained a `.cargo-ok` file.
  [#8835](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8835)

### Nightly only
- Fixed a panic with `cargo doc -Zfeatures=itarget` in some situations.
  [#8777](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8777)
- New implementation for namespaced features, using the syntax `dep:serde`.
  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#namespaced-features)
  [#8799](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8799)
- Added support for "weak" dependency features, using the syntax
  `dep_name?/feat_name`, which will enable a feature for a dependency without
  also enabling the dependency.
  [#8818](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8818)
- Fixed the new feature resolver downloading extra dependencies that weren't
  strictly necessary.
  [#8823](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8823)
- Vendored builds now work with `-Zbuild-std`.
  [#8834](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8834)

## Cargo 1.48 (2020-11-19)
[51b66125...rust-1.48.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/51b66125...rust-1.48.0)

### Added
- Added `term.progress` configuration option to control when and how the
  progress bar is displayed.
  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/config.html#termprogresswhen)
  [#8165](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8165)
- Added `--message-format plain` option to `cargo locate-project` to display
  the project location without JSON to make it easier to use in a script.
  [#8707](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8707)
- Added `--workspace` option to `cargo locate-project` to display the path to
  the workspace manifest.
  [#8712](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8712)
- A new contributor guide has been added for contributing to Cargo itself.
  This is published at <https://rust-lang.github.io/cargo/contrib/>.
  [#8715](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8715)
- Zsh `--target` completion will now complete with the built-in rustc targets.
  [#8740](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8740)

### Changed

### Fixed
- Fixed `cargo new` creating a fossil repository to properly ignore the `target` directory.
  [#8671](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8671)
- Don't show warnings about the workspace in the current directory when using `cargo install`
  of a remote package.
  [#8681](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8681)
- Automatically reinitialize the index when an "Object not found" error is
  encountered in the git repository.
  [#8735](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8735)
- Updated libgit2, which brings in several fixes for git repository handling.
  [#8778](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8778)
  [#8780](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8780)

### Nightly only
- Fixed `cargo install` so that it will ignore the `[unstable]` table in local config files.
  [#8656](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8656)
- Fixed nondeterministic behavior of the new feature resolver.
  [#8701](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8701)
- Fixed running `cargo test` on a proc-macro with the new feature resolver
  under a specific combination of circumstances.
  [#8742](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8742)

## Cargo 1.47 (2020-10-08)
[4f74d9b2...rust-1.47.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/4f74d9b2...rust-1.47.0)

### Added
- `cargo doc` will now include the package's version in the left sidebar.
  [#8509](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8509)
- Added the `test` field to `cargo metadata` targets.
  [#8478](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8478)
- Cargo's man pages are now displayed via the `cargo help` command (such as
  `cargo help build`).
  [#8456](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8456)
  [#8577](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8577)
- Added new documentation chapters on [how dependency resolution
  works](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/resolver.html) and
  [SemVer
  compatibility](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/semver.html),
  along with suggestions on how to version your project and work with
  dependencies.
  [#8609](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8609)

### Changed
- The comments added to `.gitignore` when it is modified have been tweaked to
  add some spacing.
  [#8476](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8476)
- `cargo metadata` output should now be sorted to be deterministic.
  [#8489](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8489)
- By default, build scripts and proc-macros are now built with `opt-level=0`
  and the default codegen units, even in release mode.
  [#8500](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8500)
- `workspace.default-members` is now filtered by `workspace.exclude`.
  [#8485](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8485)
- `workspace.members` globs now ignore non-directory paths.
  [#8511](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8511)
- git zlib errors now trigger a retry.
  [#8520](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8520)
- "http" class git errors now trigger a retry.
  [#8553](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8553)
- git dependencies now override the `core.autocrlf` git configuration value to
  ensure they behave consistently across platforms, particularly when
  vendoring git dependencies on Windows.
  [#8523](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8523)
- If `Cargo.lock` needs to be updated, then it will be automatically
  transitioned to the new V2 format. This format removes the `[metadata]`
  table, and should be easier to merge changes in source control systems. This
  format was introduced in 1.38, and made the default for new projects in
  1.41.
  [#8554](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8554)
- Added preparation for support of git repositories with a non-"master"
  default branch. Actual support will arrive in a future version. This
  introduces some warnings:
  - Warn if a git dependency does not specify a branch, and the default branch
    on the repository is not "master". In the future, Cargo will fetch the
    default branch. In this scenario, the branch should be explicitly
    specified.
  - Warn if a workspace has multiple dependencies to the same git repository,
    one without a `branch` and one with `branch="master"`. Dependencies should
    all use one form or the other.
  [#8522](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8522)
- Warnings are now issued if a `required-features` entry lists a feature that
  does not exist.
  [#7950](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7950)
- Built-in aliases are now included in `cargo --list`.
  [#8542](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8542)
- `cargo install` with a specific version that has been yanked will now
  display an error message that it has been yanked, instead of "could not
  find".
  [#8565](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8565)
- `cargo publish` with a package that has the `publish` field set to a single
  registry, and no `--registry` flag has been given, will now publish to that
  registry instead of generating an error.
  [#8571](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8571)

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where if a project directory was moved, and one of the
  build scripts did not use the `rerun-if-changed` directive, then that
  build script was being rebuilt when it shouldn't.
  [#8497](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8497)
- Console colors should now work on Windows 7 and 8.
  [#8540](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8540)
- The `CARGO_TARGET_{triplet}_RUNNER` environment variable will now correctly
  override the config file instead of trying to merge the commands.
  [#8629](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8629)
- Fixed LTO with doctests.
  [#8657](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8657)
  [#8658](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8658)

### Nightly only
- Added support for `-Z terminal-width` which tells `rustc` the width of the
  terminal so that it can format diagnostics better.
  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#terminal-width)
  [#8427](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8427)
- Added ability to configure `-Z` unstable flags in config files via the
  `[unstable]` table.
  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html)
  [#8393](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8393)
- Added `-Z build-std-features` flag to set features for the standard library.
  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#build-std-features)
  [#8490](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8490)

## Cargo 1.46 (2020-08-27)
[9fcb8c1d...rust-1.46.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/9fcb8c1d...rust-1.46.0)

### Added
- The `dl` key in `config.json` of a registry index now supports the
  replacement markers `{prefix}` and `{lowerprefix}` to allow spreading crates
  across directories similar to how the index itself is structured.
  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/registries.html#index-format)
  [#8267](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8267)
- Added new environment variables that are set during compilation:
  - `CARGO_CRATE_NAME`: The name of the crate being built.
  - `CARGO_BIN_NAME`: The name of the executable binary (if this is a binary crate).
  - `CARGO_PKG_LICENSE`: The `license` field from the manifest.
  - `CARGO_PKG_LICENSE_FILE`: The `license-file` field from the manifest.
  [#8270](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8270)
  [#8325](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8325)
  [#8387](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8387)
- If the value for `readme` is not specified in `Cargo.toml`, it is now
  automatically inferred from the existence of a file named `README`,
  `README.md`, or `README.txt`. This can be suppressed by setting
  `readme = false`.
  [#8277](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8277)
- `cargo install` now supports the `--index` flag to install directly from an index.
  [#8344](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8344)
- Added the `metadata` table to the `workspace` definition in `Cargo.toml`.
  This can be used for arbitrary data similar to the `package.metadata` table.
  [#8323](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8323)
- Added the `--target-dir` flag to `cargo install` to set the target directory.
  [#8391](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8391)
- Changes to environment variables used by the
  [`env!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.env.html) or
  [`option_env!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.option_env.html) macros
  are now automatically detected to trigger a rebuild.
  [#8421](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8421)
- The `target` directory now includes the `CACHEDIR.TAG` file which is used by
  some tools to exclude the directory from backups.
  [#8378](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8378)
- Added docs about rustup's `+toolchain` syntax.
  [#8455](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8455)

### Changed
- A warning is now displayed if a git dependency includes a `#` fragment in
  the URL. This was potentially confusing because Cargo itself displays git
  URLs with this syntax, but it does not have any meaning outside of the
  `Cargo.lock` file, and would not work properly.
  [#8297](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8297)
- Various optimizations and fixes for bitcode embedding and LTO.
  [#8349](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8349)
- Reduced the amount of data fetched for git dependencies. If Cargo knows the
  branch or tag to fetch, it will now only fetch that branch or tag instead of
  all branches and tags.
  [#8363](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8363)
- Enhanced git fetch error messages.
  [#8409](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8409)
- `.crate` files are now generated with GNU tar format instead of UStar, which
  supports longer file names.
  [#8453](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8453)

### Fixed
- Fixed a rare situation where an update to `Cargo.lock` failed once, but then
  subsequent runs allowed it proceed.
  [#8274](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8274)
- Removed assertion that Windows dylibs must have a `.dll` extension. Some
  custom JSON spec targets may change the extension.
  [#8310](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8310)
- Updated libgit2, which brings in a fix for zlib errors for some remote
  git servers like googlesource.com.
  [#8320](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8320)
- Fixed the GitHub fast-path check for up-to-date git dependencies on
  non-master branches.
  [#8363](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8363)
- Fixed issue when enabling a feature with `pkg/feature` syntax, and `pkg` is
  an optional dependency, but also a dev-dependency, and the dev-dependency
  appears before the optional normal dependency in the registry summary, then
  the optional dependency would not get activated.
  [#8395](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8395)
- Fixed `clean -p` deleting the build directory if there is a test named
  `build`.
  [#8398](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8398)
- Fixed indentation of multi-line Cargo error messages.
  [#8409](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8409)
- Fixed issue where the automatic inclusion of the `--document-private-items`
  flag for rustdoc would override any flags passed to the `cargo rustdoc`
  command.
  [#8449](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8449)
- Cargo will now include a version in the hash of the fingerprint directories
  to support backwards-incompatible changes to the fingerprint structure.
  [#8473](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8473)
  [#8488](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8488)

### Nightly only
- Added `-Zrustdoc-map` feature which provides external mappings for rustdoc
  (such as https://docs.rs/ links).
  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#rustdoc-map)
  [#8287](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8287)
- Fixed feature calculation when a proc-macro is declared in `Cargo.toml` with
  an underscore (like `proc_macro = true`).
  [#8319](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8319)
- Added support for setting `-Clinker` with `-Zdoctest-xcompile`.
  [#8359](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8359)
- Fixed setting the `strip` profile field in config files.
  [#8454](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8454)

## Cargo 1.45 (2020-07-16)
[ebda5065e...rust-1.45.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/ebda5065...rust-1.45.0)

### Added

### Changed
- Changed official documentation to recommend `.cargo/config.toml` filenames
  (with the `.toml` extension). `.toml` extension support was added in 1.39.
  [#8121](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8121)
- The `registry.index` config value is no longer allowed (it has been
  deprecated for 4 years).
  [#7973](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7973)
- An error is generated if both `--index` and `--registry` are passed
  (previously `--index` was silently ignored).
  [#7973](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7973)
- The `registry.token` config value is no longer used with the `--index` flag.
  This is intended to avoid potentially leaking the crates.io token to another
  registry.
  [#7973](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7973)
- Added a warning if `registry.token` is used with source replacement. It is
  intended this will be an error in future versions.
  [#7973](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7973)
- Windows GNU targets now copy `.dll.a` import library files for DLL crate
  types to the output directory.
  [#8141](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8141)
- Dylibs for all dependencies are now unconditionally copied to the output
  directory. Some obscure scenarios can cause an old dylib to be referenced
  between builds, and this ensures that all the latest copies are used.
  [#8139](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8139)
- `package.exclude` can now match directory names. If a directory is
  specified, the entire directory will be excluded, and Cargo will not attempt
  to inspect it further. Previously Cargo would try to check every file in the
  directory which could cause problems if the directory contained unreadable
  files.
  [#8095](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8095)
- When packaging with `cargo publish` or `cargo package`, Cargo can use git to
  guide its decision on which files to include. Previously this git-based
  logic required a `Cargo.toml` file to exist at the root of the repository.
  This is no longer required, so Cargo will now use git-based guidance even if
  there is not a `Cargo.toml` in the root of the repository.
  [#8095](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8095)
- While unpacking a crate on Windows, if it fails to write a file because the
  file is a reserved Windows filename (like "aux.rs"), Cargo will display an
  extra message to explain why it failed.
  [#8136](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8136)
- Failures to set mtime on files are now ignored. Some filesystems did not
  support this.
  [#8185](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8185)
- Certain classes of git errors will now recommend enabling
  `net.git-fetch-with-cli`.
  [#8166](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8166)
- When doing an LTO build, Cargo will now instruct rustc not to perform
  codegen when possible. This may result in a faster build and use less disk
  space. Additionally, for non-LTO builds, Cargo will instruct rustc to not
  embed LLVM bitcode in libraries, which should decrease their size.
  [#8192](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8192)
  [#8226](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8226)
  [#8254](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8254)
- The implementation for `cargo clean -p` has been rewritten so that it can
  more accurately remove the files for a specific package.
  [#8210](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8210)
- The way Cargo computes the outputs from a build has been rewritten to be
  more complete and accurate. Newly tracked files will be displayed in JSON
  messages, and may be uplifted to the output directory in some cases. Some of
  the changes from this are:

  - `.exp` export files on Windows MSVC dynamic libraries are now tracked.
  - Proc-macros on Windows track import/export files.
  - All targets (like tests, etc.) that generate separate debug files
    (pdb/dSYM) are tracked.
  - Added .map files for wasm32-unknown-emscripten.
  - macOS dSYM directories are tracked for all dynamic libraries
    (dylib/cdylib/proc-macro) and for build scripts.

  There are a variety of other changes as a consequence of this:

  - Binary examples on Windows MSVC with a hyphen will now show up twice in
    the examples directory (`foo_bar.exe` and `foo-bar.exe`). Previously Cargo
    just renamed the file instead of hard-linking it.
  - Example libraries now follow the same rules for hyphen/underscore
    translation as normal libs (they will now use underscores).

  [#8210](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8210)
- Cargo attempts to scrub any secrets from the debug log for HTTP debugging.
  [#8222](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8222)
- Context has been added to many of Cargo's filesystem operations, so that
  error messages now provide more information, such as the path that caused
  the problem.
  [#8232](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8232)
- Several commands now ignore the error if stdout or stderr is closed while it
  is running. For example `cargo install --list | grep -q cargo-fuzz` would
  previously sometimes panic because `grep -q` may close stdout before the
  command finishes. Regular builds continue to fail if stdout or stderr is
  closed, matching the behavior of many other build systems.
  [#8236](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8236)
- If `cargo install` is given an exact version, like `--version=1.2.3`, it
  will now avoid updating the index if that version is already installed, and
  exit quickly indicating it is already installed.
  [#8022](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8022)
- Changes to the `[patch]` section will now attempt to automatically update
  `Cargo.lock` to the new version. It should now also provide better error
  messages for the rare cases where it is unable to automatically update.
  [#8248](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8248)

### Fixed
- Fixed copying Windows `.pdb` files to the output directory when the filename
  contained dashes.
  [#8123](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8123)
- Fixed error where Cargo would fail when scanning if a package is inside a
  git repository when any of its ancestor paths is a symlink.
  [#8186](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8186)
- Fixed `cargo update` with an unused `[patch]` so that it does not get
  stuck and refuse to update.
  [#8243](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8243)
- Fixed a situation where Cargo would hang if stderr is closed, and the
  compiler generated a large number of messages.
  [#8247](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8247)
- Fixed backtraces on macOS not showing filenames or line numbers. As a
  consequence of this, binary executables on apple targets do not include a
  hash in the filename in Cargo's cache. This means Cargo can only track one
  copy, so if you switch features or rustc versions, Cargo will need to
  rebuild the executable.
  [#8329](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8329)
  [#8335](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8335)
- Fixed fingerprinting when using lld on Windows with a dylib. Cargo was
  erroneously thinking the dylib was never fresh.
  [#8290](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8290)
  [#8335](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8335)

### Nightly only
- Fixed passing the full path for `--target` to `rustdoc` when using JSON spec
  targets.
  [#8094](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8094)
- `-Cembed-bitcode=no` renamed to `-Cbitcode-in-rlib=no`
  [#8134](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8134)
- Added new `resolver` field to `Cargo.toml` to opt-in to the new feature
  resolver.
  [#8129](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8129)
- `-Zbuild-std` no longer treats std dependencies as "local". This means that
  it won't use incremental compilation for those dependencies, removes them
  from dep-info files, and caps lints at "allow".
  [#8177](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8177)
- Added `-Zmultitarget` which allows multiple `--target` flags to build the
  same thing for multiple targets at once.
  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#multitarget)
  [#8167](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8167)
- Added `strip` option to the profile to remove symbols and debug information.
  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#profile-strip-option)
  [#8246](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8246)
- Fixed panic with `cargo tree --target=all -Zfeatures=all`.
  [#8269](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8269)

## Cargo 1.44 (2020-06-04)
[bda50510...rust-1.44.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/bda50510...rust-1.44.0)

### Added
- 🔥 Added the `cargo tree` command.
  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/commands/cargo-tree.html)
  [#8062](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8062)
- Added warnings if a package has Windows-restricted filenames (like `nul`,
  `con`, `aux`, `prn`, etc.).
  [#7959](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7959)
- Added a `"build-finished"` JSON message when compilation is complete so that
  tools can detect when they can stop listening for JSON messages with
  commands like `cargo run` or `cargo test`.
  [#8069](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8069)

### Changed
- Valid package names are now restricted to Unicode XID identifiers. This is
  mostly the same as before, except package names cannot start with a number
  or `-`.
  [#7959](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7959)
- `cargo new` and `init` will warn or reject additional package names
  (reserved Windows names, reserved Cargo directories, non-ASCII names,
  conflicting std names like `core`, etc.).
  [#7959](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7959)
- Tests are no longer hard-linked into the output directory (`target/debug/`).
  This ensures tools will have access to debug symbols and execute tests in
  the same way as Cargo. Tools should use JSON messages to discover the path
  to the executable.
  [#7965](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7965)
- Updating git submodules now displays an "Updating" message for each
  submodule.
  [#7989](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7989)
- File modification times are now preserved when extracting a `.crate` file.
  This reverses the change made in 1.40 where the mtime was not preserved.
  [#7935](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7935)
- Build script warnings are now displayed separately when the build script
  fails.
  [#8017](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8017)
- Removed the `git-checkout` subcommand.
  [#8040](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8040)
- The progress bar is now enabled for all unix platforms. Previously it was
  only Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD.
  [#8054](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8054)
- Artifacts generated by pre-release versions of `rustc` now share the same
  filenames. This means that changing nightly versions will not leave stale
  files in the build directory.
  [#8073](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8073)
- Invalid package names are rejected when using renamed dependencies.
  [#8090](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8090)
- Added a certain class of HTTP2 errors as "spurious" that will get retried.
  [#8102](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8102)
- Allow `cargo package --list` to succeed, even if there are other validation
  errors (such as `Cargo.lock` generation problem, or missing dependencies).
  [#8175](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8175)
  [#8215](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8215)

### Fixed
- Cargo no longer buffers excessive amounts of compiler output in memory.
  [#7838](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7838)
- Symbolic links in git repositories now work on Windows.
  [#7996](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7996)
- Fixed an issue where `profile.dev` was not loaded from a config file with
  `cargo test` when the `dev` profile was not defined in `Cargo.toml`.
  [#8012](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8012)
- When a binary is built as an implicit dependency of an integration test,
  it now checks `dep_name/feature_name` syntax in `required-features` correctly.
  [#8020](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8020)
- Fixed an issue where Cargo would not detect that an executable (such as an
  integration test) needs to be rebuilt when the previous build was
  interrupted with Ctrl-C.
  [#8087](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8087)
- Protect against some (unknown) situations where Cargo could panic when the
  system monotonic clock doesn't appear to be monotonic.
  [#8114](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8114)
- Fixed panic with `cargo clean -p` if the package has a build script.
  [#8216](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8216)

### Nightly only
- Fixed panic with new feature resolver and required-features.
  [#7962](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7962)
- Added `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER` environment variable, which provides a way
  to wrap `rustc` for workspace members only, and affects the filename hash so
  that artifacts produced by the wrapper are cached separately. This usage can
  be seen on nightly clippy with `cargo clippy -Zunstable-options`.
  [#7533](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7533)
- Added `--unit-graph` CLI option to display Cargo's internal dependency graph
  as JSON.
  [#7977](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7977)
- Changed `-Zbuild_dep` to `-Zhost_dep`, and added proc-macros to the feature
  decoupling logic.
  [#8003](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8003)
  [#8028](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8028)
- Fixed so that `--crate-version` is not automatically passed when the flag
  is found in `RUSTDOCFLAGS`.
  [#8014](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8014)
- Fixed panic with `-Zfeatures=dev_dep` and `check --profile=test`.
  [#8027](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8027)
- Fixed panic with `-Zfeatures=itarget` with certain host dependencies.
  [#8048](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8048)
- Added support for `-Cembed-bitcode=no`, which provides a performance boost
  and disk-space usage reduction for non-LTO builds.
  [#8066](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8066)
- `-Zpackage-features` has been extended with several changes intended to make
  it easier to select features on the command-line in a workspace.
  [#8074](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8074)

## Cargo 1.43 (2020-04-23)
[9d32b7b0...rust-1.43.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/9d32b7b0...rust-1.43.0)

### Added
- 🔥 Profiles may now be specified in config files (and environment variables).
  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/config.html#profile)
  [#7823](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7823)
- ❗ Added `CARGO_BIN_EXE_<name>` environment variable when building
  integration tests. This variable contains the path to any `[[bin]]` targets
  in the package. Integration tests should use the `env!` macro to determine
  the path to a binary to execute.
  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html#environment-variables-cargo-sets-for-crates)
  [#7697](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7697)

### Changed
- `cargo install --git` now honors workspaces in a git repository. This allows
  workspace settings, like `[patch]`, `[replace]`, or `[profile]` to be used.
  [#7768](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7768)
- `cargo new` will now run `rustfmt` on the new files to pick up rustfmt
  settings like `tab_spaces` so that the new file matches the user's preferred
  indentation settings.
  [#7827](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7827)
- Environment variables printed with "very verbose" output (`-vv`) are now
  consistently sorted.
  [#7877](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7877)
- Debug logging for fingerprint rebuild-detection now includes more information.
  [#7888](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7888)
  [#7890](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7890)
  [#7952](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7952)
- Added warning during publish if the license-file doesn't exist.
  [#7905](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7905)
- The `license-file` file is automatically included during publish, even if it
  is not explicitly listed in the `include` list or is in a location outside
  of the root of the package.
  [#7905](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7905)
- `CARGO_CFG_DEBUG_ASSERTIONS` and `CARGO_CFG_PROC_MACRO` are no longer set
  when running a build script. These were inadvertently set in the past, but
  had no meaning as they were always true. Additionally, `cfg(proc-macro)`
  is no longer supported in a `target` expression.
  [#7943](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7943)
  [#7970](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7970)

### Fixed
- Global command-line flags now work with aliases (like `cargo -v b`).
  [#7837](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7837)
- Required-features using dependency syntax (like `renamed_dep/feat_name`) now
  handle renamed dependencies correctly.
  [#7855](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7855)
- Fixed a rare situation where if a build script is run multiple times during
  the same build, Cargo will now keep the results separate instead of losing
  the output of the first execution.
  [#7857](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7857)
- Fixed incorrect interpretation of environment variable
  `CARGO_TARGET_*_RUNNER=true` as a boolean. Also improved related env var
  error messages.
  [#7891](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7891)
- Updated internal libgit2 library, bringing various fixes to git support.
  [#7939](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7939)
- `cargo package` / `cargo publish` should no longer buffer the entire
  contents of each file in memory.
  [#7946](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7946)
- Ignore more invalid `Cargo.toml` files in a git dependency. Cargo currently
  walks the entire repo to find the requested package. Certain invalid
  manifests were already skipped, and now it should skip all of them.
  [#7947](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7947)

### Nightly only
- Added `build.out-dir` config variable to set the output directory.
  [#7810](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7810)
- Added `-Zjobserver-per-rustc` feature to support improved performance for
  parallel rustc.
  [#7731](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7731)
- Fixed filename collision with `build-std` and crates like `cc`.
  [#7860](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7860)
- `-Ztimings` will now save its report even if there is an error.
  [#7872](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7872)
- Updated `--config` command-line flag to support taking a path to a config
  file to load.
  [#7901](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7901)
- Added new feature resolver.
  [#7820](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7820)
- Rustdoc docs now automatically include the version of the package in the
  side bar (requires `-Z crate-versions` flag).
  [#7903](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7903)

## Cargo 1.42 (2020-03-12)
[0bf7aafe...rust-1.42.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/0bf7aafe...rust-1.42.0)

### Added
- Added documentation on git authentication.
  [#7658](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7658)
- Bitbucket Pipeline badges are now supported on crates.io.
  [#7663](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7663)
- `cargo vendor` now accepts the `--versioned-dirs` option to force it to
  always include the version number in each package's directory name.
  [#7631](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7631)
- The `proc_macro` crate is now automatically added to the extern prelude for
  proc-macro packages. This means that `extern crate proc_macro;` is no longer
  necessary for proc-macros.
  [#7700](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7700)

### Changed
- Emit a warning if `debug_assertions`, `test`, `proc_macro`, or `feature=` is
  used in a `cfg()` expression.
  [#7660](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7660)
- Large update to the Cargo documentation, adding new chapters on Cargo
  targets, workspaces, and features.
  [#7733](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7733)
- Windows: `.lib` DLL import libraries are now copied next to the dll for all
  Windows MSVC targets. Previously it was only supported for
  `pc-windows-msvc`. This adds DLL support for `uwp-windows-msvc` targets.
  [#7758](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7758)
- The `ar` field in the `[target]` configuration is no longer read. It has
  been ignored for over 4 years.
  [#7763](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7763)
- Bash completion file simplified and updated for latest changes.
  [#7789](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7789)
- Credentials are only loaded when needed, instead of every Cargo command.
  [#7774](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7774)

### Fixed
- Removed `--offline` empty index check, which was a false positive in some
  cases.
  [#7655](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7655)
- Files and directories starting with a `.` can now be included in a package
  by adding it to the `include` list.
  [#7680](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7680)
- Fixed `cargo login` removing alternative registry tokens when previous
  entries existed in the credentials file.
  [#7708](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7708)
- Fixed `cargo vendor` from panicking when used with alternative registries.
  [#7718](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7718)
- Fixed incorrect explanation in the fingerprint debug log message.
  [#7749](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7749)
- A `[source]` that is defined multiple times will now result in an error.
  Previously it was randomly picking a source, which could cause
  non-deterministic behavior.
  [#7751](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7751)
- `dep_kinds` in `cargo metadata` are now de-duplicated.
  [#7756](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7756)
- Fixed packaging where `Cargo.lock` was listed in `.gitignore` in a
  subdirectory inside a git repository. Previously it was assuming
  `Cargo.lock` was at the root of the repo.
  [#7779](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7779)
- Partial file transfer errors will now cause an automatic retry.
  [#7788](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7788)
- Linux: Fixed panic if CPU iowait stat decreases.
  [#7803](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7803)
- Fixed using the wrong sysroot for detecting host compiler settings when
  `--sysroot` is passed in via `RUSTFLAGS`.
  [#7798](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7798)

### Nightly only
- `build-std` now uses `--extern` instead of `--sysroot` to find sysroot
  packages.
  [#7699](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7699)
- Added `--config` command-line option to set config settings.
  [#7649](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7649)
- Added `include` config setting which allows including another config file.
  [#7649](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7649)
- Profiles in config files now support any named profile. Previously it was
  limited to dev/release.
  [#7750](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7750)

## Cargo 1.41 (2020-01-30)
[5da4b4d4...rust-1.41.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/5da4b4d4...rust-1.41.0)

### Added
- 🔥 Cargo now uses a new `Cargo.lock` file format. This new format should
  support easier merges in source control systems. Projects using the old
  format will continue to use the old format, only new `Cargo.lock` files will
  use the new format.
  [#7579](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7579)
- 🔥 `cargo install` will now upgrade already installed packages instead of
  failing.
  [#7560](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7560)
- 🔥 Profile overrides have been added. This allows overriding profiles for
  individual dependencies or build scripts. See [the
  documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/profiles.html#overrides)
  for more.
  [#7591](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7591)

- Add back support for `BROWSER` environment variable for `cargo doc --open`.
  [#7576](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7576)
- Added `kind` and `platform` for dependencies in `cargo metadata`.
  [#7132](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7132)
- The `OUT_DIR` value is now included in the `build-script-executed` JSON message.
  [#7622](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7622)

### Changed
- `cargo doc` will now document private items in binaries by default.
  [#7593](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7593)
- Subcommand typo suggestions now include aliases.
  [#7486](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7486)
- Tweak how the "already existing..." comment is added to `.gitignore`.
  [#7570](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7570)
- Ignore `cargo login` text from copy/paste in token.
  [#7588](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7588)
- Windows: Ignore errors for locking files when not supported by the filesystem.
  [#7602](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7602)
- Remove `**/*.rs.bk` from `.gitignore`.
  [#7647](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7647)

### Fixed
- Fix unused warnings for some keys in the `build` config section.
  [#7575](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7575)
- Linux: Don't panic when parsing `/proc/stat`.
  [#7580](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7580)
- Don't show canonical path in `cargo vendor`.
  [#7629](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7629)

### Nightly only


## Cargo 1.40 (2019-12-19)
[1c6ec66d...5da4b4d4](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/1c6ec66d...5da4b4d4)

### Added
- Added `http.ssl-version` config option to control the version of TLS,
  along with min/max versions.
  [#7308](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7308)
- 🔥 Compiler warnings are now cached on disk. If a build generates warnings,
  re-running the build will now re-display the warnings.
  [#7450](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7450)
- Added `--filter-platform` option to `cargo metadata` to narrow the nodes
  shown in the resolver graph to only packages included for the given target
  triple.
  [#7376](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7376)

### Changed
- Cargo's "platform" `cfg` parsing has been extracted into a separate crate
  named `cargo-platform`.
  [#7375](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7375)
- Dependencies extracted into Cargo's cache no longer preserve mtimes to
  reduce syscall overhead.
  [#7465](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7465)
- Windows: EXE files no longer include a metadata hash in the filename.
  This helps with debuggers correlating the filename with the PDB file.
  [#7400](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7400)
- Wasm32: `.wasm` files are no longer treated as an "executable", allowing
  `cargo test` and `cargo run` to work properly with the generated `.js` file.
  [#7476](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7476)
- crates.io now supports SPDX 3.6 licenses.
  [#7481](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7481)
- Improved cyclic dependency error message.
  [#7470](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7470)
- Bare `cargo clean` no longer locks the package cache.
  [#7502](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7502)
- `cargo publish` now allows dev-dependencies without a version key to be
  published. A git or path-only dev-dependency will be removed from the
  package manifest before uploading.
  [#7333](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7333)
- `--features` and `--no-default-features` in the root of a virtual workspace
  will now generate an error instead of being ignored.
  [#7507](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7507)
- Generated files (like `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`) in a package archive
  now have their timestamp set to the current time instead of the epoch.
  [#7523](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7523)
- The `-Z` flag parser is now more strict, rejecting more invalid syntax.
  [#7531](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7531)

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where if a package had an `include` field, and `Cargo.lock`
  in `.gitignore`, and a binary or example target, and the `Cargo.lock` exists
  in the current project, it would fail to publish complaining the
  `Cargo.lock` was dirty.
  [#7448](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7448)
- Fixed a panic in a particular combination of `[patch]` entries.
  [#7452](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7452)
- Windows: Better error message when `cargo test` or `rustc` crashes in an
  abnormal way, such as a signal or seg fault.
  [#7535](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7535)

### Nightly only
- The `mtime-on-use` feature may now be enabled via the
  `unstable.mtime_on_use` config option.
  [#7411](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7411)
- Added support for named profiles.
  [#6989](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6989)
- Added `-Zpanic-abort-tests` to allow building and running tests with the
  "abort" panic strategy.
  [#7460](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7460)
- Changed `build-std` to use `--sysroot`.
  [#7421](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7421)
- Various fixes and enhancements to `-Ztimings`.

  [#7428](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7428)
  [#7429](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7429)
- Profile overrides have renamed the syntax to be
  `[profile.dev.package.NAME]`.
  [#7504](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7504)
- Fixed warnings for unused profile overrides in a workspace.

## Cargo 1.39 (2019-11-07)
[e853aa97...1c6ec66d](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/e853aa97...1c6ec66d)

### Added
- Config files may now use the `.toml` filename extension.
  [#7295](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7295)
- The `--workspace` flag has been added as an alias for `--all` to help avoid
  confusion about the meaning of "all".
  [#7241](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7241)
- The `publish` field has been added to `cargo metadata`.
  [#7354](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7354)

### Changed
- Display more information if parsing the output from `rustc` fails.
  [#7236](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7236)
- TOML errors now show the column number.
  [#7248](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7248)
- `cargo vendor` no longer deletes files in the `vendor` directory that starts
  with a `.`.
  [#7242](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7242)
- `cargo fetch` will now show manifest warnings.
  [#7243](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7243)
- `cargo publish` will now check git submodules if they contain any
  uncommitted changes.
  [#7245](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7245)
- In a build script, `cargo:rustc-flags` now allows `-l` and `-L` flags
  without spaces.
  [#7257](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7257)
- When `cargo install` replaces an older version of a package it will now
  delete any installed binaries that are no longer present in the newly
  installed version.
  [#7246](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7246)
- A git dependency may now also specify a `version` key when published. The
  `git` value will be stripped from the uploaded crate, matching the behavior
  of `path` dependencies.
  [#7237](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7237)
- The behavior of workspace default-members has changed. The default-members
  now only applies when running Cargo in the root of the workspace. Previously
  it would always apply regardless of which directory Cargo is running in.
  [#7270](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7270)
- libgit2 updated pulling in all upstream changes.
  [#7275](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7275)
- Bump `home` dependency for locating home directories.
  [#7277](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7277)
- zsh completions have been updated.
  [#7296](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7296)
- SSL connect errors are now retried.
  [#7318](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7318)
- The jobserver has been changed to acquire N tokens (instead of N-1), and
  then immediately acquires the extra token. This was changed to accommodate
  the `cc` crate on Windows to allow it to release its implicit token.
  [#7344](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7344)
- The scheduling algorithm for choosing which crate to build next has been
  changed. It now chooses the crate with the greatest number of transitive
  crates waiting on it. Previously it used a maximum topological depth.
  [#7390](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7390)
- RUSTFLAGS are no longer incorporated in the metadata and filename hash,
  reversing the change from 1.33 that added it. This means that any change to
  RUSTFLAGS will cause a recompile, and will not affect symbol munging.
  [#7459](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7459)

### Fixed
- Git dependencies with submodules with shorthand SSH URLs (like
  `git@github.com/user/repo.git`) should now work.
  [#7238](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7238)
- Handle broken symlinks when creating `.dSYM` symlinks on macOS.
  [#7268](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7268)
- Fixed issues with multiple versions of the same crate in a `[patch]` table.
  [#7303](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7303)
- Fixed issue with custom target `.json` files where a substring of the name
  matches an unsupported crate type (like "bin").
  [#7363](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/7363)
- Fixed issues with generating documentation for proc-macro crate types.
  [#7159](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7159)
- Fixed hang if Cargo panics within a build thread.
  [#7366](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7366)
- Fixed rebuild detection if a `build.rs` script issues different `rerun-if`
  directives between builds. Cargo was erroneously causing a rebuild after the
  change.
  [#7373](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7373)
- Properly handle canonical URLs for `[patch]` table entries, preventing
  the patch from working after the first time it is used.
  [#7368](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7368)
- Fixed an issue where integration tests were waiting for the package binary
  to finish building before starting their own build. They now may build
  concurrently.
  [#7394](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7394)
- Fixed accidental change in the previous release on how `--features a b` flag
  is interpreted, restoring the original behavior where this is interpreted as
  `--features a` along with the argument `b` passed to the command. To pass
  multiple features, use quotes around the features to pass multiple features
  like `--features "a b"`, or use commas, or use multiple `--features` flags.
  [#7419](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7419)

### Nightly only
- Basic support for building the standard library directly from Cargo has been
  added.
  ([docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#build-std))
  [#7216](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7216)
- Added `-Ztimings` feature to generate an HTML report on the time spent on
  individual compilation steps. This also may output completion steps on the
  console and JSON data.
  ([docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#timings))
  [#7311](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7311)
- Added ability to cross-compile doctests.
  ([docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#doctest-xcompile))
  [#6892](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6892)

## Cargo 1.38 (2019-09-26)
[4c1fa54d...23ef9a4e](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/4c1fa54d...23ef9a4e)

### Added
- 🔥 Cargo build pipelining has been enabled by default to leverage more idle CPU
  parallelism during builds.
  [#7143](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7143)
- The `--message-format` option to Cargo can now be specified multiple times and
  accepts a comma-separated list of values. In addition to the previous values
  it also now accepts `json-diagnostic-short` and
  `json-diagnostic-rendered-ansi` which configures the output coming from rustc
  in `json` message mode.
  [#7214](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7214)
- Cirrus CI badges are now supported on crates.io.
  [#7119](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7119)
- A new format for `Cargo.lock` has been introduced. This new format is
  intended to avoid source-control merge conflicts more often, and to
  generally make it safer to merge changes. This new format is *not* enabled
  at this time, though Cargo will use it if it sees it. At some point in the
  future, it is intended that this will become the default.
  [#7070](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7070)
- Progress bar support added for FreeBSD.
  [#7222](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7222)

### Changed
- The `-q` flag will no longer suppress the root error message for an error
  from Cargo itself.
  [#7116](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7116)
- The Cargo Book is now published with mdbook 0.3 providing a number of
  formatting fixes and improvements.
  [#7140](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7140)
- The `--features` command-line flag can now be specified multiple times.
  The list of features from all the flags are joined together.
  [#7084](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7084)
- Package include/exclude glob-vs-gitignore warnings have been removed.
  Packages may now use gitignore-style matching without producing any
  warnings.
  [#7170](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7170)
- Cargo now shows the command and output when parsing `rustc` output fails
  when querying `rustc` for information like `cfg` values.
  [#7185](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7185)
- `cargo package`/`cargo publish` now allows a symbolic link to a git
  submodule to include that submodule.
  [#6817](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6817)
- Improved the error message when a version requirement does not
  match any versions, but there are pre-release versions available.
  [#7191](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7191)

### Fixed
- Fixed using the wrong directory when updating git repositories when using
  the `git-fetch-with-cli` config option, and the `GIT_DIR` environment
  variable is set. This may happen when running cargo from git callbacks.
  [#7082](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7082)
- Fixed dep-info files being overwritten for targets that have separate debug
  outputs. For example, binaries on `-apple-` targets with `.dSYM` directories
  would overwrite the `.d` file.
  [#7057](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7057)
- Fix `[patch]` table not preserving "one major version per source" rule.
  [#7118](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7118)
- Ignore `--remap-path-prefix` flags for the metadata hash in the `cargo
  rustc` command. This was causing the remap settings to inadvertently affect
  symbol names.
  [#7134](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7134)
- Fixed cycle detection in `[patch]` dependencies.
  [#7174](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7174)
- Fixed `cargo new` leaving behind a symlink on Windows when `core.symlinks`
  git config is true. Also adds a number of fixes and updates from upstream
  libgit2.
  [#7176](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7176)
- macOS: Fixed setting the flag to mark the `target` directory to be excluded
  from backups.
  [#7192](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7192)
- Fixed `cargo fix` panicking under some situations involving multi-byte
  characters.
  [#7221](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7221)

### Nightly only
- Added `cargo fix --clippy` which will apply machine-applicable fixes from
  Clippy.
  [#7069](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7069)
- Added `-Z binary-dep-depinfo` flag to add change tracking for binary
  dependencies like the standard library.
  [#7137](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7137)
  [#7219](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7219)
- `cargo clippy-preview` will always run, even if no changes have been made.
  [#7157](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7157)
- Fixed exponential blowup when using `CARGO_BUILD_PIPELINING`.
  [#7062](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7062)
- Fixed passing args to clippy in `cargo clippy-preview`.
  [#7162](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7162)

## Cargo 1.37 (2019-08-15)
[c4fcfb72...9edd0891](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/c4fcfb72...9edd0891)

### Added
- Added `doctest` field to `cargo metadata` to determine if a target's
  documentation is tested.
  [#6953](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6953)
  [#6965](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6965)
- 🔥 The [`cargo
  vendor`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/commands/cargo-vendor.html)
  command is now built-in to Cargo. This command may be used to create a local
  copy of the sources of all dependencies.
  [#6869](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6869)
- 🔥 The "publish lockfile" feature is now stable. This feature will
  automatically include the `Cargo.lock` file when a package is published if
  it contains a binary executable target. By default, Cargo will ignore
  `Cargo.lock` when installing a package. To force Cargo to use the
  `Cargo.lock` file included in the published package, use `cargo install
  --locked`. This may be useful to ensure that `cargo install` consistently
  reproduces the same result. It may also be useful when a semver-incompatible
  change is accidentally published to a dependency, providing a way to fall
  back to a version that is known to work.
  [#7026](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7026)
- 🔥 The `default-run` feature has been stabilized. This feature allows you to
  specify which binary executable to run by default with `cargo run` when a
  package includes multiple binaries. Set the `default-run` key in the
  `[package]` table in `Cargo.toml` to the name of the binary to use by
  default.
  [#7056](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7056)

### Changed
- `cargo package` now verifies that build scripts do not create empty
  directories.
  [#6973](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6973)
- A warning is now issued if `cargo doc` generates duplicate outputs, which
  causes files to be randomly stomped on. This may happen for a variety of
  reasons (renamed dependencies, multiple versions of the same package,
  packages with renamed libraries, etc.). This is a known bug, which needs
  more work to handle correctly.
  [#6998](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6998)
- Enabling a dependency's feature with `--features foo/bar` will no longer
  compile the current crate with the `foo` feature if `foo` is not an optional
  dependency.
  [#7010](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7010)
- If `--remap-path-prefix` is passed via RUSTFLAGS, it will no longer affect
  the filename metadata hash.
  [#6966](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6966)
- libgit2 has been updated to 0.28.2, which Cargo uses to access git
  repositories. This brings in hundreds of changes and fixes since it was last
  updated in November.
  [#7018](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7018)
- Cargo now supports absolute paths in the dep-info files generated by rustc.
  This is laying the groundwork for [tracking
  binaries](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/61727), such as libstd, for
  rebuild detection. (Note: this contains a known bug.)
  [#7030](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7030)

### Fixed
- Fixed how zsh completions fetch the list of commands.
  [#6956](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6956)
- "+ debuginfo" is no longer printed in the build summary when `debug` is set
  to 0.
  [#6971](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6971)
- Fixed `cargo doc` with an example configured with `doc = true` to document
  correctly.
  [#7023](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7023)
- Don't fail if a read-only lock cannot be acquired in CARGO_HOME. This helps
  when CARGO_HOME doesn't exist, but `--locked` is used which means CARGO_HOME
  is not needed.
  [#7149](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7149)
- Reverted a change in 1.35 which released jobserver tokens when Cargo blocked
  on a lock file. It caused a deadlock in some situations.
  [#7204](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7204)

### Nightly only
- Added [compiler message
  caching](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#cache-messages).
  The `-Z cache-messages` flag makes cargo cache the compiler output so that
  future runs can redisplay previous warnings.
  [#6933](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6933)
- `-Z mtime-on-use` no longer touches intermediate artifacts.
  [#7050](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7050)

## Cargo 1.36 (2019-07-04)
[6f3e9c36...c4fcfb72](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/6f3e9c36...c4fcfb72)

### Added
- Added more detailed documentation on target auto-discovery.
  [#6898](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6898)
- 🔥 Stabilize the `--offline` flag which allows using cargo without a network
  connection.
  [#6934](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6934)
  [#6871](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6871)

### Changed
- `publish = ["crates-io"]` may be added to the manifest to restrict
  publishing to crates.io only.
  [#6838](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6838)
- macOS: Only include the default paths if `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH` is not
  set. Also, remove `/lib` from the default set.
  [#6856](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6856)
- `cargo publish` will now exit early if the login token is not available.
  [#6854](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6854)
- HTTP/2 stream errors are now considered "spurious" and will cause a retry.
  [#6861](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6861)
- Setting a feature on a dependency where that feature points to a *required*
  dependency is now an error. Previously it was a warning.
  [#6860](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6860)
- The `registry.index` config value now supports relative `file:` URLs.
  [#6873](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6873)
- macOS: The `.dSYM` directory is now symbolically linked next to example
  binaries without the metadata hash so that debuggers can find it.
  [#6891](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6891)
- The default `Cargo.toml` template for now projects now includes a comment
  providing a link to the documentation.
  [#6881](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6881)
- Some improvements to the wording of the crate download summary.
  [#6916](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6916)
  [#6920](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6920)
- ✨ Changed `RUST_LOG` environment variable to `CARGO_LOG` so that user code
  that uses the `log` crate will not display cargo's debug output.
  [#6918](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6918)
- `Cargo.toml` is now always included when packaging, even if it is not listed
  in `package.include`.
  [#6925](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6925)
- Package include/exclude values now use gitignore patterns instead of glob
  patterns. [#6924](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6924)
- Provide a better error message when crates.io times out. Also improve error
  messages with other HTTP response codes.
  [#6936](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6936)

### Performance
- Resolver performance improvements for some cases.
  [#6853](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6853)
- Optimized how cargo reads the index JSON files by caching the results.
  [#6880](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6880)
  [#6912](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6912)
  [#6940](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6940)
- Various performance improvements.
  [#6867](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6867)

### Fixed
- More carefully track the on-disk fingerprint information for dependencies.
  This can help in some rare cases where the build is interrupted and
  restarted. [#6832](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6832)
- `cargo run` now correctly passes non-UTF8 arguments to the child process.
  [#6849](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6849)
- Fixed bash completion to run on bash 3.2, the stock version in macOS.
  [#6905](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6905)
- Various fixes and improvements to zsh completion.
  [#6926](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6926)
  [#6929](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6929)
- Fix `cargo update` ignoring `-p` arguments if the `Cargo.lock` file was
  missing.
  [#6904](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6904)

### Nightly only
- Added [`-Z install-upgrade`
  feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#install-upgrade)
  to track details about installed crates and to update them if they are
  out-of-date. [#6798](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6798)
- Added the [`public-dependency`
  feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#public-dependency)
  which allows tracking public versus private dependencies.
  [#6772](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6772)
- Added build pipelining via the `build.pipelining` config
  option (`CARGO_BUILD_PIPELINING` env var).
  [#6883](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6883)
- The `publish-lockfile` feature has had some significant changes. The default
  is now `true`, the `Cargo.lock` will always be published for binary crates.
  The `Cargo.lock` is now regenerated during publishing. `cargo install` now
  ignores the `Cargo.lock` file by default, and requires `--locked` to use the
  lock file. Warnings have been added if yanked dependencies are detected.
  [#6840](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6840)

## Cargo 1.35 (2019-05-23)
[6789d8a0...6f3e9c36](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/6789d8a0...6f3e9c36)

### Added
- Added the `rustc-cdylib-link-arg` key for build scripts to specify linker
  arguments for cdylib crates.
  [#6298](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6298)

### Changed
- When passing a test filter, such as `cargo test foo`, don't build examples
  (unless they set `test = true`).
  [#6683](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6683)
- Forward the `--quiet` flag from `cargo test` to the libtest harness so that
  tests are actually quiet.
  [#6358](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6358)
- The verification step in `cargo package` that checks if any files are
  modified is now stricter. It uses a hash of the contents instead of checking
  filesystem mtimes. It also checks *all* files in the package.
  [#6740](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6740)
- Jobserver tokens are now released whenever Cargo blocks on a file lock.
  [#6748](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6748)
- Issue a warning for a previous bug in the TOML parser that allowed multiple
  table headers with the same name.
  [#6761](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6761)
- Removed the `CARGO_PKG_*` environment variables from the metadata hash and
  added them to the fingerprint instead. This means that when these values
  change, stale artifacts are not left behind. Also added the "repository"
  value to the fingerprint.
  [#6785](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6785)
- `cargo metadata` no longer shows a `null` field for a dependency without a
  library in `resolve.nodes.deps`. The dependency is no longer shown.
  [#6534](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6534)
- `cargo new` will no longer include an email address in the `authors` field
  if it is set to the empty string.
  [#6802](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6802)
- `cargo doc --open` now works when documenting multiple packages.
  [#6803](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6803)
- `cargo install --path P` now loads the `.cargo/config` file from the
  directory P. [#6805](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6805)
- Using semver metadata in a version requirement (such as `1.0.0+1234`) now
  issues a warning that it is ignored.
  [#6806](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6806)
- `cargo install` now rejects certain combinations of flags where some flags
  would have been ignored.
  [#6801](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6801)
- Resolver performance improvements for some cases.
  [#6776](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6776)

### Fixed
- Fixed running separate commands (such as `cargo build` then `cargo test`)
  where the second command could use stale results from a build script.
  [#6720](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6720)
- Fixed `cargo fix` not working properly if a `.gitignore` file that matched
  the root package directory.
  [#6767](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6767)
- Fixed accidentally compiling a lib multiple times if `panic=unwind` was set
  in a profile. [#6781](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6781)
- Paths to JSON files in `build.target` config value are now canonicalized to
  fix building dependencies.
  [#6778](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6778)
- Fixed re-running a build script if its compilation was interrupted (such as
  if it is killed). [#6782](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6782)
- Fixed `cargo new` initializing a fossil repo.
  [#6792](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6792)
- Fixed supporting updating a git repo that has a force push when using the
  `git-fetch-with-cli` feature. `git-fetch-with-cli` also shows more error
  information now when it fails.
  [#6800](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6800)
- `--example` binaries built for the WASM target are fixed to no longer
  include a metadata hash in the filename, and are correctly emitted in the
  `compiler-artifact` JSON message.
  [#6812](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6812)

### Nightly only
- `cargo clippy-preview` is now a built-in cargo command.
  [#6759](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6759)
- The `build-override` profile setting now includes proc-macros and their
  dependencies.
  [#6811](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6811)
- Optional and target dependencies now work better with `-Z offline`.
  [#6814](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6814)

## Cargo 1.34 (2019-04-11)
[f099fe94...6789d8a0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/f099fe94...6789d8a0)

### Added
- 🔥 Stabilized support for [alternate
  registries](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.34.0/cargo/reference/registries.html).
  [#6654](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6654)
- Added documentation on using builds.sr.ht Continuous Integration with Cargo.
  [#6565](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6565)
- `Cargo.lock` now includes a comment at the top that it is `@generated`.
  [#6548](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6548)
- Azure DevOps badges are now supported.
  [#6264](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6264)
- Added a warning if `--exclude` flag specifies an unknown package.
  [#6679](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6679)

### Changed
- `cargo test --doc --no-run` doesn't do anything, so it now displays an error
  to that effect. [#6628](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6628)
- Various updates to bash completion: add missing options and commands,
  support libtest completions, use rustup for `--target` completion, fallback
  to filename completion, fix editing the command line.
  [#6644](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6644)
- Publishing a crate with a `[patch]` section no longer generates an error.
  The `[patch]` section is removed from the manifest before publishing.
  [#6535](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6535)
- `build.incremental = true` config value is now treated the same as
  `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1`, previously it was ignored.
  [#6688](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6688)
- Errors from a registry are now always displayed regardless of the HTTP
  response code. [#6771](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6771)

  [#6578](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6578)
- Fixed a race condition when using a *local* registry and running multiple
  cargo commands at the same time that build the same crate.
  [#6591](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6591)
- Fixed some flickering and excessive updates of the progress bar.
  [#6615](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6615)
- Fixed a hang when using a git credential helper that returns incorrect
  credentials. [#6681](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6681)
- Fixed resolving yanked crates with a local registry.
  [#6750](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6750)

### Nightly only
- Added `-Z mtime-on-use` flag to cause the mtime to be updated on the
  filesystem when a crate is used. This is intended to be able to track stale
  artifacts in the future for cleaning up unused files.
  [#6477](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6477)
  [#6573](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6573)
- Added experimental `-Z dual-proc-macros` to build proc macros for both the
  host and the target.
  [#6547](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6547)

## Cargo 1.33 (2019-02-28)
[8610973a...f099fe94](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/8610973a...f099fe94)

### Added
- `compiler-artifact` JSON messages now include an `"executable"` key which
  includes the path to the executable that was built.
  [#6363](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6363)
- The man pages have been rewritten, and are now published with the web
  documentation. [#6405](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6405)
- `cargo login` now displays a confirmation after saving the token.
  [#6466](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6466)
- A warning is now emitted if a `[patch]` entry does not match any package.
  [#6470](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6470)
- `cargo metadata` now includes the `links` key for a package.
  [#6480](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6480)
- "Very verbose" output with `-vv` now displays the environment variables that
  cargo sets when it runs a process.
  [#6492](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6492)
- `--example`, `--bin`, `--bench`, or `--test` without an argument now lists
  the available targets for those options.
  [#6505](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6505)
- Windows: If a process fails with an extended status exit code, a
  human-readable name for the code is now displayed.
  [#6532](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6532)
- Added `--features`, `--no-default-features`, and `--all-features` flags to
  the `cargo package` and `cargo publish` commands to use the given features
  when verifying the package.
  [#6453](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6453)

### Changed
- If `cargo fix` fails to compile the fixed code, the rustc errors are now
  displayed on the console.
  [#6419](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6419)
- Hide the `--host` flag from `cargo login`, it is unused.
  [#6466](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6466)
- Build script fingerprints now include the rustc version.
  [#6473](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6473)
- macOS: Switched to setting `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH` instead of
  `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`. [#6355](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6355)
- `RUSTFLAGS` is now included in the metadata hash, meaning that changing
  the flags will not overwrite previously built files.
  [#6503](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6503)
- When updating the crate graph, unrelated yanked crates were erroneously
  removed. They are now kept at their original version if possible. This was
  causing unrelated packages to be downgraded during `cargo update -p
  somecrate`. [#5702](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5702)
- TOML files now support the [0.5 TOML
  syntax](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#050--2018-07-11).

### Fixed
- `cargo fix` will now ignore suggestions that modify multiple files.
  [#6402](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6402)
- `cargo fix` will now only fix one target at a time, to deal with targets
  which share the same source files.
  [#6434](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6434)
- Fixed bash completion showing the list of cargo commands.
  [#6461](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6461)
- `cargo init` will now avoid creating duplicate entries in `.gitignore`
  files. [#6521](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6521)
- Builds now attempt to detect if a file is modified in the middle of a
  compilation, allowing you to build again and pick up the new changes. This
  is done by keeping track of when the compilation *starts* not when it
  finishes. Also, [#5919](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5919) was
  reverted, meaning that cargo does *not* treat equal filesystem mtimes as
  requiring a rebuild. [#6484](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6484)

### Nightly only
- Allow using registry *names* in `[patch]` tables instead of just URLs.
  [#6456](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6456)
- `cargo metadata` added the `registry` key for dependencies.
  [#6500](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6500)

  [#6466](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6466)
- Registries may now elide the `api` key from `config.json` to indicate they
  do not support API access.
  [#6466](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6466)
- Fixed panic when using `--message-format=json` with metabuild.
  [#6432](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6432)
- Fixed detection of publishing to crates.io when using alternate registries.
  [#6525](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6525)

  to the documentation. [#6321](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6321)
- Added the alias `c` for `cargo check`.
  [#6218](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6218)

### Changed

  config value may be used to disable it.
  [#6271](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6271)
- Use ANSI escape sequences to clear lines instead of spaces.
  [#6233](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6233)
- Disable git templates when checking out git dependencies, which can cause
  problems. [#6252](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6252)
- Include the `--update-head-ok` git flag when using the
  `net.git-fetch-with-cli` option. This can help prevent failures when
  fetching some repositories.
  [#6250](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6250)
- When extracting a crate during the verification step of `cargo package`, the
  filesystem mtimes are no longer set, which was failing on some rare
  filesystems. [#6257](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6257)
- `crate-type = ["proc-macro"]` is now treated the same as `proc-macro = true`
  in `Cargo.toml`. [#6256](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6256)
- An error is raised if `dependencies`, `features`, `target`, or `badges` is
  set in a virtual workspace. Warnings are displayed if `replace` or `patch`
  is used in a workspace member.
  [#6276](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6276)
- Improved performance of the resolver in some cases.
  [#6283](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6283)
  [#6366](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6366)
- `.rmeta` files are no longer hard-linked into the base target directory
  (`target/debug`). [#6292](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6292)
- A warning is issued if multiple targets are built with the same output
  filenames. [#6308](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6308)
- When using `cargo build` (without `--release`) benchmarks are now built
  using the "test" profile instead of "bench". This makes it easier to debug
  benchmarks, and avoids confusing behavior.
  [#6309](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6309)
- User aliases may now override built-in aliases (`b`, `r`, `t`, and `c`).
  [#6259](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6259)
- Setting `autobins=false` now disables auto-discovery of inferred targets.
  [#6329](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6329)
- `cargo verify-project` will now fail on stable if the project uses unstable
  features. [#6326](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6326)
- Platform targets with an internal `.` within the name are now allowed.
  [#6255](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6255)
- `cargo clean --release` now only deletes the release directory.
  [#6349](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6349)

### Fixed

  [#6243](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6243)
- The progress bar is disabled if the CI environment variable is set.
  [#6281](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6281)
- Avoid retaining all rustc output in memory.
  [#6289](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6289)

  message. [#6290](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6290)
- Fixed renaming a project directory with build scripts.
  [#6328](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6328)
- Fixed `cargo run --example NAME` to work correctly if the example sets
  `crate_type = ["bin"]`.
  [#6330](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6330)
- Fixed issue with `cargo package` git discovery being too aggressive. The
  `--allow-dirty` now completely disables the git repo checks.
  [#6280](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6280)
- Fixed build change tracking for `[patch]` deps which resulted in `cargo
  build` rebuilding when it shouldn't.
  [#6493](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6493)

### Nightly only
- Allow usernames in registry URLs.
  [#6242](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6242)
- Added `"compile_mode"` key to the build-plan JSON structure to be able to
  distinguish running a custom build script versus compiling the build script.
  [#6331](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6331)
- `--out-dir` no longer copies over build scripts.
  [#6300](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6300)

  [#6181](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6181)
- When building in "very verbose" mode (`cargo build -vv`), build script
  output is prefixed with the package name and version, such as `[foo 0.0.1]`.
  [#6164](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6164)
- If `cargo fix --broken-code` fails to compile after fixes have been applied,
  the files are no longer reverted and are left in their broken state.
  [#6316](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6316)

### Fixed
- Windows: Pass Ctrl-C to the process with `cargo run`.
  [#6004](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6004)
- macOS: Fix bash completion.
  [#6038](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6038)

- 🔥 Added an animated progress bar shows progress during building.
  [#5995](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5995/)
- Added `resolve.nodes.deps` key to `cargo metadata`, which includes more
  information about resolved dependencies, and properly handles renamed
  dependencies. [#5871](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5871)
- When creating a package, provide more detail with `-v` when failing to
  discover if files are dirty in a git repository. Also fix a problem with
  discovery on Windows. [#5858](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5858)
- Filters like `--bin`, `--test`, `--example`, `--bench`, or `--lib` can be
  used in a workspace without selecting a specific package.
  [#5873](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5873)
- `cargo run` can be used in a workspace without selecting a specific package.
  [#5877](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5877)

  current git hash. [#5886](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5886)
- Added `net.git-fetch-with-cli` configuration option to use the `git`
  executable to fetch repositories instead of using the built-in libgit2
  library. [#5914](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5914)
- Added `required-features` to `cargo metadata`.
  [#5902](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5902)
- `cargo uninstall` within a package will now uninstall that package.
  [#5927](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5927)
- Added `--allow-staged` flag to `cargo fix` to allow it to run if files are
  staged in git. [#5943](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5943)
- Added `net.low-speed-limit` config value, and also honor `net.timeout` for
  http operations. [#5957](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5957)

  --open`. This should more reliably select the system-preferred browser on
  all platforms. [#5888](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5888)
- Equal file mtimes now cause a target to be rebuilt. Previously only if files
  were strictly *newer* than the last build would it cause a rebuild.
